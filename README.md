# 🚀 STM32 Embedded Systems Projects

This repository showcases a collection of embedded system projects developed using **STM32 microcontrollers**. These projects focus on **real-time applications** such as automation, smart sensing, and digital control systems.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Microcontroller:** STM32 (various series)
- **IDE:** STM32CubeIDE
- **Code Generation:** STM32CubeMX
- **Firmware Libraries:** STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)
- **RTOS:** FreeRTOS (for real-time task scheduling)

## 🛠️ Key Features
- Real-world applications: Automated waste sorting, motor control, and sensor-based systems
- Peripherals used: 
  - **ADC** (Analog to Digital Conversion)
  - **PWM** (Pulse Width Modulation)
  - **UART** (Serial Communication)
  - **I2C** (Sensor communication)
  - **GPIOs** (Input/Output control)
- Real-time task management with **FreeRTOS**


## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `.ioc` file with STM32CubeMX (optional for regeneration).
3. Open the project with **STM32CubeIDE**.
4. Connect your STM32 board.
5. Build and flash the firmware.

## 📌 Applications
- Automated Waste Sorting System
- Smart Sensor Integration
- Motor and Servo Control
- Real-Time Monitoring & Response Systems
